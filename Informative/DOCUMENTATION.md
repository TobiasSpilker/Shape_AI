# Reasonably sized documentation

**ABOUT:**
This is the documentation for Shape_AI. In short, Shape_AI is an image recognition model which uses a peculiar way of data preperation. The algorithm for converting images into readable data for neural networks is very efficient because it selects for the right amount of detail from an image while the output data stays very small in size. The advantage of this is a huge boost in efficiency. In this documentation we will gloss over the inner workers of the entire program, it consists of several parts. The first two parts are about 1: The Data preperation, and 2: The neural network itself.
