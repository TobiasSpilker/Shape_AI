In order to keep the repository organized and uniform there are a few basic rules to adhere to. These are regarding Git, coding, good / bad practices etc. See list below:

<br/>

1. Make sure you have installed GitHub Desktop (https://desktop.github.com/). This will make it possible for you to commit changes from your own computer. This has several advantages regarding work flow. 

2. Write clear and concise code. Make no unnecessary methods and make sure that your code is efficient.

3. Document extensively, meaning that you should leave lots of comments in your code. Specifically under classes, methods, complex variable declerations. Below is an example of well documented code out of this project:

4. Extensive documentation also generalizes to other parts of the workflow, specifically Git. When committing changes, especially to code, you should give a detailed description of the changes you've made.
